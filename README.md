# Jetson_Bolt_Bits
These are the torque arms and other stuff I designed for the Jetson Bolt Pro with upgraded motor.

Jetson_Torque_Arm_Left, Jetson_Torque_Arm_Right: These are non-slotted, so the chain cannot be adjusted. There is a feature to mount a Litepro Chain tensioner here:

**Configuration 2**
Jetson_Torque_Arm_Left_Slotted, Jetson_Torque_Arm_Slotted: These are slotted so you can adjust the chain. No need for the chain tensioner. If for some reason you want to run slotted plates and still use a tensioner, you can use Jetson_Torque_Arm_Right_SLotted instead of Jetson_Torque_Arm_Slotted on the right side.
Tire Fitment: Should fit any tires that work on the Jetson normally.

**Configuration 3**
Jetson_Torque_Arm_Slotted (both sides): This is a slotted option and there are no extra features, just the torque plates mounting to the

- This is a universal torque arm for the Jetson Bolt Pro. It should work on either side, so make two.
- There is a hole to fit a 3/8 bolt through so you can mount some sweet foot pegs with 3/8" thread. You may have to file the hole inthe Jetson bottom bracket a bit to make the bolt head fit.
- You will need to find some M5 screws to attach these (exact size TBD).
- You will NOT be able to adjust your chain tension with these. I may redo these with a slot or something.
