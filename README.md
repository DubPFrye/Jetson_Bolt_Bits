# Jetson_Bolt_Bits
These are the torque arms and other stuff I designed for the Jetson Bolt Pro with upgraded motor.

**NOTE**
As of 7/31/23, I have not received my first set of these torque arms, so I cannot confirm that they fit correctly. I would recommend waiting until I update this repo with a confirmation that I didn't fuck up, but If you are willing to take a chance that I nailed the design, feel free to order them now.

Instructions:
- Go to SendCutSend.com.
- Make an account.
- Upload these .dxf files to your account.
- choose mm as the measurement units.
- choose the listed material (or whatever material you fancy).
- add to cart and buy.

Files Available here:

Jetson_Torque_Arm.dxf:
- This is a universal torque arm for the Jetson Bolt Pro. It should work on either side, so make two.
- There is a hole to fit a 3/8 bolt through so you can mount some sweet foot pegs with 3/8" thread. You may have to file the hole inthe Jetson bottom bracket a bit to make the bolt head fit.
- You will need to find some M5 screws to attach these (exact size TBD).
- You will NOT be able to adjust your chain tension with these. I may redo these with a slot or something.
- I recommend making out of 4130 Chromoly, 4.83mm thick.

Jetson_Torque_Arm_Left.dxf:
- This is a left side torque arm with a slot feature to mount the kick stand in front of teh axle. I hate having it sandwiched in on the rear axle, but that's just me. 
- There is a hole to fit a 3/8 bolt through so you can mount some sweet foot pegs with 3/8" thread. You may have to file the hole inthe Jetson bottom bracket a bit to make the bolt head fit.
- You will need to find some M5 screws to attach these (exact size TBD).
- I recommend making out of 4130 Chromoly, 4.83mm thick.

Jetson_Torque_Arm_Right.dxf:
- This is a right side torque arm with a feature for mounting a LitePro chain tensioner.
